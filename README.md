中文用户看不懂英语没关系，网页右侧有个 "Download ZIP" 按钮，点一下等一会儿就可以下载整个项目，找不到就点[这个](https://github.com/oing9179/osuBeatmapsBlocker_dotNet2/archive/master.zip)，效果一样。然后直接找bin文件夹下的主程序，随便解压缩到哪儿运行都可。<br/>
主程序会释放一个.txt文件用来配置屏蔽文件列表，里面有详细的注释，可以手动修改哦~<br/>
### The application.
Current version: 1.0.1.9<br/>
Special thanks: Shadow Power<br/>
Build with VisualStudio2012, but you can edit with VistualStudio2010, just edit .sln file with text editor(like Notepad++), and edit it you know.<br/>
The main language is Chinese-Simplified, so you can translate it and release with my name.<br/>
### Dear [peppy](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/2)
I just want play happy without cheat, unlike the application osu!AutoPlayer.<br/>
I can not calculate the timeline for Slider because I can not understand .osu file part of Sliders, and the XNA Framework is no longer up-to-date(M$ try to discard it maybe).
But I will save the code until I have found the next way to cheat, only for study and develop program.<br/>
And do not BAN my account please.
